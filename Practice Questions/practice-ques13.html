        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <strong>Amayra Fashion' s</strong>
        <p>We started this business in early 90's. Idea came into mind when I was designed clothes for my two months old daughter Amayra. Then I realize not only me but so many new mother's like me also faced the same problem so we decided to bring solution of their problem in form of Amayra fashion's.</p>
