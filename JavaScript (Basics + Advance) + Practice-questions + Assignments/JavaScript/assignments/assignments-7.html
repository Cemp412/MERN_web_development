    <h3>Qs1. Write an arrow function named array Average that accepts an array of numbers and returns average of those numbers.</h3>
    <script>
        const arrayAvg = (arr) => {
            let total = 0;
            for(let number of arr) {
                total += number;
            }
            return total / arr.length;
        };

        let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
        console.log(arrayAvg(arr));
    </script>

    <h3>Qs2. Write an arrow function named isEven() that takes a single number as argument and returns if it is even or not.</h3>
    <script>
        let num = 4;
        const isEven =  (num) => num % 2 == 0;
    </script>
    <h3>Qs3. What is the output of the following code: </h3>
    <p>Ans3. After delay of 1 second, undefined is logged to the console. While the setTimeout() function uses the object.logMessage as a callback, still, it invoes the object. logMessage as a regular function, rather than a method. <br>
        And during a regular function invocation "this" equals the global object, which is a window in the case of browser environment.
        <br> That's why console.log(this.message) inside logMessage method logs window.message, which is undefined.
    </p>
    <script>
        const object = {
            message: "Hello World",
            logMessage() {
                console.log(this.message);
            }
        }

        setTimeout(object.logMessage, 1000);
    </script>

    <h3>Qs4. What is the output of the following code:</h3>
    <p>Ans4. 'Hello World!', is logged to the console.
        <br>
        object.getMessage() is a method invocation, that's why "this" inside the method equals object. <br>
        There's also a variable declaration const message = "Hello, Earth!" inside the method.The variable doesn't influence the value of this.message.
    </p>
    <script>
        let length = 4;
        function callback() {
            console.log(this.length);
        }

        const obj = {
            length: 5,
            method(callback) {
                callback();
            },
        };
        obj.method(callback, 1, 2);
    </script>
